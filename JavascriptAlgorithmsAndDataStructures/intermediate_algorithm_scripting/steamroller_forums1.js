/*

    Create a new variable to keep flattened arrays.
    Create a function that will add non-array elements to the new variable, and for the ones that are array, loop through them to get the element.
    It does that by using recursion, if the element is an array then call the function again with a layer of array deeper to check if it is an array or not. If it is not then push that non-array element to the variable that gets returned. Otherwise, keep going deeper.
    Invoke the function, the first time you will always pass it an array, so it always falls into the isArray branch
    Return the flattened array.
