Label Bootstrap Buttons

Just like we labeled our wells, we want to label our buttons.

Give each of your button elements text that corresponds to its id's selector.

Your button element with the id target1 should have the text #target1.
Your button element with the id target2 should have the text #target2.
Your button element with the id target3 should have the text #target3.
Your button element with the id target4 should have the text #target4.
Your button element with the id target5 should have the text #target5.
Your button element with the id target6 should have the text #target6.
