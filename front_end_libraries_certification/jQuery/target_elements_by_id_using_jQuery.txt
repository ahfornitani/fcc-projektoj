Target Elements by id Using jQuery

You can also target elements by their id attributes.

First target your button element with the id target3 by using the $("#target3") selector.

Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a # before the id's name.

Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and fadeOut.

Here's how you'd make the button element with the id target6 fade out:

$("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut")

You should select the button element with the id of target3 and use the jQuery addClass() function to give it the class of animated.
You should target the element with the id target3 and use the jQuery addClass() function to give it the class fadeOut.
You should only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.
