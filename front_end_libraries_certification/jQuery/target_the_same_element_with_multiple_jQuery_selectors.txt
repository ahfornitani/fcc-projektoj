Now you know three ways of targeting elements: by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn"), and by id $("#target1").

Although it is possible to add multiple classes in a single .addClass() call, let's add them to the same element in three separate ways.

Using .addClass(), add only one class at a time to the same element, three different ways:

Add the animated class to all elements with type button.

Add the shake class to all the buttons with class .btn.

Add the btn-primary class to the button with id #target1.

Note
You should only be targeting one element and adding only one class at a time. Altogether, your three individual selectors will end up adding the three classes shake, animated, and btn-primary to #target1.

Your code should use the $("button") selector.
Your code should use the $(".btn") selector.
Your code should use the $("#target1") selector.
You should only add one class with each of your three selectors.
Your #target1 element should have the classes animatedâ€š shake and btn-primary.
You should only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.
