Render State in the User Interface Another Way

There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

In the MyComponent render method, define a const called name and set it equal to the name value in the component's state. Because you can write JavaScript directly in this part of the code, you don't have to enclose this reference in curly braces.

Next, in the return statement, render this value in an h1 tag using the variable name. Remember, you need to use the JSX syntax (curly braces for JavaScript) in the return statement.

MyComponent should have a key name with value freeCodeCamp stored in its state.
MyComponent should render an h1 header enclosed in a single div.
The rendered h1 tag should include a reference to {name}.
The rendered h1 header should contain text rendered from the component's state.
